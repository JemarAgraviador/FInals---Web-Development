# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

>This Program aims to store a table that contains simple book properties such as name author and their code, and stores a record of the borrow and returns.

# ABOUT
>This project is made to comply to our Final Project in DC101 and CC105, I used ASP.NET Core Web API in which I realized way too late that its harder to use than in VS Code, however i figured to still continue even with the realization midway, that way I'd learn more about how API's work and according to some sources, using ASP.NET Core Web API is great for long term, as even though it might be punishing and strict in syntax, the structure it makes is stable and actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it.

# CHALLENGES
>First challenge was to learn how the structure works, but eventually i got the hang of it, although i still cant write the syntax myself because i dont know Javascript and most C# syntax for connecting databases, mentally i get how it works by reading the code.

>I faced a challenge i did not expect, one of my tables in sql isnt even used, technically a redundant, so i just have to remove it and is left with two tables.

>Juggle learning Javascript, C# syntaxes for Controllers, HTML and CSS at such a short time, HTML and CSS are the programming languages i hate the most, i find it boring and too... Front-y, I'm more into logic than design.
